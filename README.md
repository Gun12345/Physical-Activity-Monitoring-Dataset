# Physical-Activity-Monitoring
The goal of this report is to create an physical activity recognition system which can easily classify the level of heartrate, type and amount of physical activity happening. Physical activity recognition is a complex problem as there are no universal standards. There are alot of variance from one subject to another, but with the help of models we can resolve this problem.

This report utilises the PAMAP2 Physical Activity Monitoring Dataset which has been provided by the University of Sussex which contains 18 different activities participated by 8 male and 1 female.
